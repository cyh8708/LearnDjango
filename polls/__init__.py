#Projects vs Apps
# An app is a Web application that does something - e.g, a weblog system, a database of public records or simple poll app.
# A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website.

# A project can contain multiple apps. VS  An app can be in multiple projects.

#Your apps can live anywhere on Python path.
#For this tutorial, we will create `poll` app, right next to manage.py file. 
#  It can be imported as its own top-level module, rather than a submodule of mysite.
